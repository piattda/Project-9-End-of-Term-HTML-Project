        <h1>Interpreting Ethics</h1>
        <p>
          How does an interpreter behave in the court room; a deposition; or a medical office?
        </p>
        <p>
          What do you do if you can't understand your client?
        </p>
        <p>Interpreting ethics are the rules that dictate how we should behave as we carry out our jobs.</p>

        <h3>How to maintain neutrality</h3>
        <p>Don't laugh or fraternize with clients or lawyers.  You are always on display.  Keep your head down and do a good job. </p>

        <a href="https://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1385"><h3>What does it mean to be an officer of the court?</h3></a>
        <p>Officers of the court aid in the effective operation of our judicial system, they have an "absolute ethical duty to tell judges the truth".</p>

          <h3> How do I clarify or correct a mistake? </h3>

          <dl>
            <dt>I didn't understand the client.</dt>
            <dd>State into the microphone that you are requesting repetition and then ask your client to repeat what they said.</dd>
            <dt>I misinterpreted a statement.</dt>
            <dd>State into the microphone that an error was made in the interpretation, correct the error on the record.
              Convey to your client what you just stated.  Keep it short, simple, keep the conversation moving and be clear.
              It's easy to become flustered, everybody messes up, it only matters that you acknowledge your error and all is easily forgiven.</dd>
              <dt>I didn't hear what was said.</dt>
              <dd>Stat into the microphone that you did not hear what was said and <i>respectfully</i> ask for repetition.  Yes, use the word "respectuflly" when you address the judge.</dd>

          <h3>Interpreting at the stand</h3>
          <p>Stand close to your clent.  As the judge is speaking quickly and quietly convey to your client what the judge is saying. </p>
          <p>When your client speaks, stop, listen to what they have to say and repeat it back into the microphone to be recorded in the record. </p>

        <div class="box-2">
          <h3>Sight Translations</h3>
          <p>From time to time the interpreter will be asked to perform a sight translation.
            The judge or an attorney may request that the interpreter read a document in the target language into English or vice-versa.
            This is also a subject on most interpreteing certification exams.</p>
